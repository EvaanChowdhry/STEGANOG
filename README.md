# Steganog - A steganography CLI for hiding files in images

By just reading that one sentence, you might be wondering, what is steganography? 

Steganography (/ˌstɛɡəˈnɒɡrəfi/ STEG-ə-NOG-rə-fee) is the practice of representing information within another message or physical object, in such a manner that the presence of the information is not evident to human inspection. In computing/electronic contexts, a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography comes from Greek steganographia, which combines the words steganós (στεγανός), meaning "covered or concealed", and -graphia (γραφή) meaning "writing". ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography))

Steganog is a CLI tool for hiding files in images. It supports all image files as long as they are jpg's. In the future I am hoping to support many more image formats. Maybe even any kind of file format.
